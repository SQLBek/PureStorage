**Miscellaneous Demo Scripts**
<p align="center"></p>
This folder contains a collection of my personal Pure Storage demo scripts.  I am only sharing these so people can see other examples, with actual variable values.  There are a few different techniques also used in here, like simple looping, multiple mount points, etc, to also give ideas of what is possible.
